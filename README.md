# Group-14 

## What are we making?
We are making an Arduino-powered car controllable through a keyboard and/or a controller. 
We will later add computer vision to it by taking screenshots and analyzing them, allowing the car to recognize the elements in front of it.

## Why are we making it?
We are making it to test/improve our coding skills and because we felt it’d be manageable and satisfying to complete, a fair challenge.

## What problem does it solve?
In current times boredom is the biggest problem for most of us. The goal of our app is to overcome that problem by letting the user explore a virtual environment with a controllable car.

## Technical information
**How will we make it?**

Our aim is to develop a desktop application that will be built with Electron (JavaScript). The app itself will allow the user to control the car.

Car’s logic will mainly rely on C++. 

We will use the OpenCV library to analyze and process the car's surroundings. Python will be used for this part of the project.
